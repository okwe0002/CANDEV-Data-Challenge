The vessel verification system will match a vessel's name and IMO number from the 'verification data' stored in a msql database. Once a vessel's name and IMO have been matched the system will return a Marine Mobile Service Identity of the vessel. The idea is that once a vessel's name and IMO have been matched between the 'verification data' and the static data provided, the vessel is 'verified' and an MMSI will be returned.
